# kiv_use_calculator

## Purpose
This is a calculator that I created in a spreadsheet for a client that I am attempting to bring into python. While I think it serves a better purpose in the spreadsheet format, this is just an attempt to spin my personal projects in the past into present projects using what I've learned over the last few months.

Desc: It works! Well I have most of it working. You can input a starting KIV, type in values, get metrics and keep track of how much oil you have left. I know the code is very ugly and can be cleaned up a lot, but I like that it works and it can reproduce results I've attained before in other mediums so I know the math is being done correctly. What I would like to do one day is clean up the amount of redundant lines in this code. I'm sure there is a way to make cleaner, more reusable functions but I just don't know what yet.
