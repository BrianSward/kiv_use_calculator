# kiv_use_calculator

## Purpose
This is a calculator that I created in a spreadsheet for a client that I am attempting to bring into python. While I think it serves a better purpose in the spreadsheet format, this is just an attempt to spin my personal projects in the past into present projects using what I've learned over the last few months.
